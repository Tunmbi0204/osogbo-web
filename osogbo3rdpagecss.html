       <h3 class="content">THE HISTORY OF OSOGBO</h3>
 
 <p class="content"></p>
      <hr>
  <p id="Lorem">The mystery behind this momentous festival can be traced to the origin of the ancient town of Osogbo, which is also the capital of Osun state, Nigeria. If our foot can no more plod back into the good old days, today history has it painted. IT all started with the covenant between their ancestor, Oba Gbadewolu Laroye, and the goddess of Osun river, as an appeasement for the damages he caused to her indigo dye, when he was craving for new settlement, in the Osun sacred groove which is about 120 acres of land, in size.
 Osun which could simply be implied to as “Orisun”, meaning, “the source”, was found to be a friendly and an accommodating river with a caring goddess (who also can be credited as a name giver, for calling the first king, Oba Gbadewolu Laroye as the “Oso-igbo”, meaning, “Wizard of the forest”, this, which birthed the name Osogbo, till today), as she didnt just accept the appeasement conferred to her, but also blessed their stay and promised to be an helper, healer, deliverer and a giver of children to those that cry and believe in her.
 The benefits that the people of Osogbo get from this annual celebration socially, culturally, mentally, morally, financially and spiritually makes them hold to what their forefathers have put in their hands since time immemorial. The Osun Osogbo sacred groove was recognized by UNESCO as the World Heritage Site, in 2005, and the light behind this could be mapped to how believers and lover of culture and tourist come from all parts of the world, to the South-west of Nigeria, in order to share from the blessings, exposure and fun of the celebration.

This African advancing cultural festival is a program of two weeks, which holds every August. The event starts with cleansing of the entire town traditionally, called “Iwopopo”, preceding lighting of the said 500 years old sixteen points lamp, “Atupa Oloju merindinlogun” in the next three days, followed by “Iboriade”, a rite that consists gathering the crowns of past rulers, “Ataojas” of Osogbo town for blessing, and it’s being led by the incumbent Ataoja. Having done the necessary rites compasses the Arugbá “a calabash bearer”, who must be a virgin maiden chosen by Yeye Osun and the committee of priestesses to carry the people’s age-long prayers with costumes to be used in the calabash, as Osun devotees follow her, in white garment.
Despite being traditional, the story of Osun Osogbo will be half-detailed without citing the efforts of a Austrian woman, Suzan Wenger, natively known as “Iwinfunmi Adunni Olorisa”, who developed interest in becoming a priestess and a custodian that began soliciting for the groove before she died at 93, in Osogbo, 2009. Truly, Osun Osogbo festival is one of the most outstanding cultural heritage that promotes Yoruba, Nigeria and Africa, to the World.
Osun-Osogbo is a sacred grove along the banks of the Osun river just outside the city of Osogbo, Osun State of Nigeria.
The Osun-Osogbo Grove is several centuries old[1] and is among the last of the sacred forests that once adjoined the edges of most Yoruba cities before extensive urbanization. In recognition of its global significance and its cultural value, the Sacred Grove was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.[2]
The 1950s witnessed the desecration of the Osun-Osogbo Grove: shrines were neglected and priests abandoned the grove as customary responsibilities and sanctions weakened. Prohibited actions like fishing, hunting and falling of trees in the Grove was done indiscriminately until an Austrian national named Susanne Wenger (1915-2009)[3]helped to reinstate traditional protections.[4]
With the support and encouragement of the Ataoja (the royal king of the time) and the support of the concerned local people. Wenger "formed the New Sacred Art movement to challenge land speculators, repel poachers, protect shrines and begin the long process of bringing the sacred place back to life by establishing it again, as the sacred heart of Osogbo".[5] Wenger later came to be honored the titled "Adunni Olorisha" for her custodial efforts and her consistent devotion to the gods of the grove.
Osun-Osogbo Festival is believed to have a history of more than 700 years. Historically, an ancestral occurrence led to the celebration of this festival. Once upon a time, a group of migrants who were led by a great hunter called Olutimehin settled on the bank of the Osun river to save themselves from famine. On the river-side, Yeye Osun the river goddess appeared from the water in front of Olutimehin and requested him to lead people to a special place (the present-day Osogbo town). The goddess promised to protect the group and bring them prosperity in return for an annual sacrifice to her. The group accepted the proposition, and today the annual sacrifice to the Osun River Goddess is still celebrated as the Osun-Osogbo Festival.[6]
In modern times, August is a month of celebration for the people of Osogbo land that includes the traditional cleansing of the city and the cultural reunion of the people with their ancestors, the founders of the Osogbo Kingdom.[7]
The Osun-Osogbo Festival itself is a two-week-long programme. The traditional cleansing of Osogbo is called 'Iwopopo', which is followed after three days by the lighting of the 500-year-old sixteen-point lamp called 'Ina Olojumerindinlogun'. Then comes the 'Iboriade', an assemblage of the crowns of the past rulers, the Ataojas of Osogbo, for blessings.
The Festival culminates in a procession to the shrine in the sacred grove where a large crowd builds up. Drumming, dancing, musical performing, wearing of elaborate costumes, speaking of the Yoruba language, recitation of praise poetry, and so on add pomp and colour to the proceedings. This event is led by the sitting Ataoja of Osogbo along with a ritualized performer called the Arugba and a committee of priestesses, who reenact the very first meeting between Oluwatimilehin and Yeye Osun.[8] Arugba is played by a young woman of a kingly lineage and offers the sacrifice to the deity.
In 2020, the procession was limited to the ritual performers and public participation was suspended due to COVID-19.[
The festival is of immense benefit to the tourism sector of Nigeria. It enables the community to sell its culture to tourists coming from both within the country and from all over the world.[10]
The Osun-Osogbo festival also serves as a strong unifying factor in Osogbo land, as irrespective of the different social, economic, religious and political convictions of the people, they all come together annually to celebrate the goddess.
The present Yoruba inhabitants of Osogbo have an oba (“king”) who functions in an advisory role and holds the traditional title of ataoja (“he who stretches out his hand and takes the fish”), first given to Laro, one of the town’s founders, who, according to legend, fed the fish of the Osun River and in return received a liquid believed to be effective against sterility in women. The river and its personification and namesake, the goddess Osun (or Oshun; a Yoruba heroine deified for her role in saving Osogbo), are honoured at an annual festival in the town in August. Two chalk- and camwood-covered shrines are connected with this worship—the Ile Osun (at the oba’s market), in which are stored the idols of the cult, and the Ojubo Osun (on a bend of the river at Laro’s original settlement), which is the centre of the worship. The Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, a forested area with shrines and sanctuaries honouring Osun and other deities, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005
The Ataoja which means the one that "stretches out his hand and takes the fish" is the traditional ruler of the people of Osogbo.[13] The following is the list of the Ataojas of Osogbo, with the dates of their rule;

Duro Ladipo, a Yoruba playwright, was inspired to start a similar club in Oshogbo, then a city of 250,000 people, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Ibadan. With the help of Beier, he converted his father’s house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays. The Oshogbo club became more than a meeting place for intellectuals. Because it was on the main road, the club attracted women on the way to the market, hunters, chiefs, kings, schoolchildren, farmers, politicians, and the unemployed, and it became a vital part of Oshogbo life. The name of the club was inadvertently altered when the Igbo word mbari was mistaken for the Yoruba phrase mbari mbayo, meaning “when we see it we shall be happy.” To reach the local, mostly Yoruba audience, Ladipo drew upon Yoruba mythology, drumming, dance, and poetry and soon developed a kind of Yoruba opera.
Beier organized art workshops in Ibadan in 1961 and 1962 and at Oshogbo in 1962 to attract unemployed primary-school dropouts. The school was run to give the artists a committed, critical audience on the theory that their art would degenerate if subjected only to undiscerning tourists. The young artists drew on their traditions and their contemporary environment and rapidly created a fresh, sophisticated art. The problem of how to protect these artists from the easy tourist market was solved by social acceptance of the Mbari Mbayo Club, which provided a lively, local, outspoken audience; soon local groups commissioned palace murals, stage sets, church doors, and an Esso gasoline station. With this firm local support, the artists were able to sell to European collectors and send exhibits abroad without compromising their art.
A number of well-known artists emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo. Twins Seven Seven was a dancer, drummer, and graphic artist; his themes were imaginative variations on Yoruba mythology and legend and were always full of humour. Jimoh Buraimoh was known for his mosaic compositions made with local beads, potsherds, or stones. Samuel Ojo worked in appliqué with cutout and embroidered fantasy-like figures. Ashiru Olatunde’s aluminum panels are found on Nigerian banks, churches, and bars and in private collections in Europe and America. His quiet folk art, which comments on Nigerian life, was as popular with farmers and market women as it was with intellectuals. Yemi Bisiri made lost-wax brass figures for the Ogboni cult, but in a contemporary style. Jinadu Oladepo created brass figures and bracelets and pendants that were worn by the Oshogbo artists as a kind of insignia. Senabu Oloyede and Kikelomo Oladepo both worked in cloth dyeing (traditionally reserved for women) and used the traditional indigo dye, producing works contemporary in style.
